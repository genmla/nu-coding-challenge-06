Weather Dashboard

## Description

This applicaiton allows for input of a city name in the search bar, then populates the current weather for that city, as well as the next five days for that city in the adjacent spaces. It appends a list of searched cities in below the "Search History" list and allows for those users to select those cities and search the selected city's weather again. With this project we learned how to use APIs to pull data, input pulled data, and output new data using another API. 

## Usage

To use this application, enter the name of a city in the search bar and click "Search." To search a previously searched city again, select it from the Search History section.
